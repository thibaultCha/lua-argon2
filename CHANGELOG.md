## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## [3.0.0]

### Changed

- :warning: This version is only compatible with Argon2
  [20160406](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/releases/tag/20160406)
  and later.
- New `variants` field with supported Argon2 encoding variants (as userdatum).
  See documentation and the "Added" section of this Changelog.

### Added

- :stars: Support for Argon2id encoding variant.
  [#24](https://github.com/thibaultcha/lua-argon2/pull/24)
- We now automatically compute the length of the retrieved encoded hash from
  `encrypt()`. [#21](https://github.com/thibaultcha/lua-argon2/pull/21)
- New option: `hash_len`.
  [#22](https://github.com/thibaultcha/lua-argon2/pull/22)
- Return errors from `verify()`. A mismatch now returns `false, nil`, while an
  error will return `nil, "err string"`.
  [#23](https://github.com/thibaultcha/lua-argon2/pull/23)
- ANSI C compatibility.
  [#27](https://github.com/thibaultcha/lua-argon2/pull/27)

  resulting hashes will not be backwards compatible.
